# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A targeted fix for the cart persistence issue in the existing MERN stack men's clothing e-commerce platform. The system currently allows users to add items to cart before authentication, but cart functionality fails after login/signup. This specification addresses the cart synchronization and persistence problems to ensure seamless cart functionality across authentication states.

## Glossary

- **Cart System**: The shopping cart functionality that manages item storage and retrieval
- **Guest Cart**: Cart items stored in browser localStorage for unauthenticated users
- **Authenticated Cart**: Cart items stored in MongoDB database for logged-in users
- **Cart Migration**: The process of transferring guest cart items to authenticated user's database cart
- **Cart Synchronization**: Ensuring cart state consistency between frontend and backend
- **Authentication State**: Whether a user is logged in (authenticated) or not (guest)
- **Cart Context**: React context managing cart state and operations in the frontend
- **Cart API**: Backend endpoints handling cart operations for authenticated users

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a guest user, I want to add items to my cart and have them persist when I register or login, so that I don't lose my selected items during authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest user adds items to cart, THE Cart System SHALL store items in browser localStorage
2. WHEN a guest user registers or logs in, THE Cart System SHALL migrate all guest cart items to their authenticated cart
3. THE Cart System SHALL preserve item quantities, sizes, and product selections during migration
4. WHEN cart migration completes, THE Cart System SHALL clear guest cart data from localStorage
5. THE Cart System SHALL handle duplicate items by merging quantities appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to add items to my cart and have them immediately available, so that I can continue shopping without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user adds items to cart, THE Cart System SHALL store items in MongoDB database
2. THE Cart System SHALL synchronize cart state between frontend and backend immediately after each operation
3. WHEN cart operations fail, THE Cart System SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
4. THE Cart System SHALL maintain cart state consistency across browser sessions for authenticated users
5. WHEN authentication token expires, THE Cart System SHALL handle re-authentication without losing cart data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user switching between guest and authenticated states, I want my cart to work consistently, so that I have a seamless shopping experience regardless of my login status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cart System SHALL provide identical cart functionality for both guest and authenticated users
2. WHEN authentication state changes, THE Cart System SHALL update cart operations to use appropriate storage method
3. THE Cart System SHALL handle authentication errors gracefully without breaking cart functionality
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur, THE Cart System SHALL provide fallback behavior for authenticated users
5. THE Cart System SHALL validate cart items against current product availability before operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities for cart operations, so that I can quickly identify and resolve cart-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cart System SHALL log detailed error information for failed cart operations
2. THE Cart System SHALL provide clear error messages for different failure scenarios
3. WHEN cart synchronization fails, THE Cart System SHALL attempt automatic retry with exponential backoff
4. THE Cart System SHALL validate authentication tokens before making cart API requests
5. THE Cart System SHALL provide debugging information for cart migration processes
